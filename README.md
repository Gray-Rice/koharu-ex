Koharu introduces a local-first workflow for manga translation, utilizing the power of ML to automate the process. It combines the capabilities of object detection, OCR, inpainting, and LLMs to create a seamless translation experience.

> [!NOTE]
> Koharu runs its vision models and LLMs **locally** on your machine to keep your data private and secure.
> It also supports third party providers for translation, which are subject to their terms and conditions.

## Features

### Extras (Refer Project Wiki for more details)
- **Better error handling and reporting for Translation:** Prevent complete failure of translation pipeline by skipping the specific page. The Old implementation would fail without any indication of progress before failure.
- **Translation pipeline summary:** Pipeline summary with errors for failed pages, success/failed counts and retry for failed pages.
- **Translation Import/Export:** JSON-based translation exchange with page-level granularity for collaborative workflows.
- **Project Archiving:** Organise projects easily with archives.
- **Rectangle Selection for Eraser & Remove Tools:** Precise region selection for targeted cleanup and inpainting.
- **Multi Layer select:** Drag to select multiple layers.
- **Fine grained export options:** Options for individual/group exports of selected pages without having to export entire project.

### Existing Features

- [Multi-format project management](https://koharu.rs/en/guides/projects) for raster images, archives, and PDFs with page sequencing
- [Selective pipeline](https://koharu.rs/en/guides/processing) for detection, OCR, translation, and inpainting at page or project scope
- [Detection and segmentation](https://koharu.rs/en/guides/processing) for text regions, speech bubbles, and cleanup regions
- [Multimodal OCR](https://koharu.rs/en/models/vision) for dialogue, captions, and general page text
- [Local GGUF inference and hosted providers](https://koharu.rs/en/models/providers) for LLM and machine-translation workflows
- [Generative inpainting](https://koharu.rs/en/guides/cleanup) for source-text removal and artwork reconstruction
- [Proofreading](https://koharu.rs/en/guides/review) for correcting OCR and translation output
- [WebGPU-based canvas](https://koharu.rs/en/guides/canvas) for manual cleanup, text placement, and page composition
- [Multilingual text shaping and layout](https://koharu.rs/en/guides/typesetting) with automatic fitting, font fallback, vertical CJK, and right-to-left text
- [Layered PSD export](https://koharu.rs/en/guides/export) for flattened delivery and layered editing
- [Agent-based workflow](https://koharu.rs/en/agent/projects) for project inspection, editing, and pipeline control

## Hardware Acceleration

Koharu supports CUDA and ROCm / HIP on Windows and Linux, Metal on Apple silicon, and Vulkan on Windows and Linux. Keep your graphics driver current; a full CUDA or ROCm SDK installation is not required. See [Runtime and hardware requirements](https://koharu.rs/en/hardware) for model-specific guidance.

### CUDA

CUDA 13.3 requires an NVIDIA Turing-class or newer GPU and an R610 or newer driver. Check NVIDIA's official [CUDA toolkit, driver, and architecture matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/drivers/cuda-toolkit-driver-and-architecture-matrix.html) and install the [latest NVIDIA driver](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/).

### ROCm / HIP

ROCm 10.0 support depends on the exact AMD GPU, operating system, and driver combination. Check AMD's official [ROCm 10.0.0 compatibility matrix](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-10.0.0/compatibility/compatibility-matrix.html) and install a compatible [AMD driver](https://www.amd.com/en/support).

### Metal

Metal is available on Apple silicon Macs.

### Vulkan

Vulkan is available on Windows and Linux as an alternative to CUDA and ROCm / HIP.

### WebGPU

The editor canvas uses WebGPU and requires a current graphics driver even when inference runs on the CPU.

### CPU

CPU inference is available for supported workloads but is substantially slower.

## Machine Learning Models

Koharu uses separate models for detection, OCR, inpainting, and translation. [Vision and inpainting](https://koharu.rs/en/models/vision) and [translation and generation](https://koharu.rs/en/models/translation) have separate model settings.

### Computer Vision Models

Detection, OCR, and inpainting models are selected separately.

#### Detection and Layout

The detection model finds text regions, speech bubbles, and segmentation masks.

- [Koharu Layout RF-DETR Seg 2XL](https://huggingface.co/mayocream/koharu-layout-rfdetr-seg-2xl-1152)

#### OCR

OCR reads source text from detected regions.

- [PaddleOCR VL 1.6](https://huggingface.co/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR-VL-1.6)
- [Manga OCR](https://huggingface.co/mayocream/manga-ocr)
- [Baberu OCR](https://huggingface.co/genshiai-daichi/baberu-ocr)
- [Hayai OCR](https://huggingface.co/JustANormalTinkerer/hayai-ocr-v2)

#### Inpainting

Inpainting reconstructs the image behind source text before the translation is rendered.

- [FLUX.2 Klein](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/FLUX.2-klein-4B-GGUF)
- [RORem mixed](https://huggingface.co/mayocream/RORem-mixed-GGUF)
- [LaMa](https://huggingface.co/mayocream/lama-manga)
- [AOT GAN](https://huggingface.co/mayocream/aot-inpainting)

### Large Language Models

Translation can use a local language model or a remote API.
